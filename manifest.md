## Agile principles
The Agile Manifesto is based on twelve principles
- 1 Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
- 2 Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
- 3 Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
- 4 Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
- 5 Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
- 6 Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
- 7 Working software is the principal measure of progress
- 8 Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
- 9 Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
- 10 Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
- 11 Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
- 12 Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
