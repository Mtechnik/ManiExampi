A common characteristic in agile is the daily "stand-up", also known as the daily scrum. In a brief session,
team members report to each other what they did the previous day toward their team's sprint goal, what they intend
to do today toward their team's sprint goal, and any roadblocks or impediments they can see to their team's sprint
goal. This is a MarkDown[md] example!
